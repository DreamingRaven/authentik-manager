Authentik Manager
=================

Just add SMTP!

Authentik-Manager is a custom authentik-helm chart with an additional operator. The helm chart helps deploy the base system, and the operator with its additional CRDs makes it easier to declaratively define your authentik setup.

Please note this is still heavily a work in progress, that has only recently started. If you like living life on the edge welcome, otherwise good news on progress should come soon.
